# Eye-Controlled Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI

## Project Description

This project leverages computer vision and machine learning to create an eye-controlled mouse interface using Python. The system utilizes OpenCV for camera interfacing and image processing, MediaPipe for facial landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse cursor. By tracking eye movements and blinks, the system can move the cursor and perform clicks, enabling hands-free computer interaction.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face and Eye Tracking**: Uses MediaPipe's FaceMesh to detect facial landmarks in real-time.
- **Cursor Control**: Maps eye movements to cursor movements across the screen.
- **Blink Detection for Clicking**: Detects blinks to simulate mouse clicks.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
